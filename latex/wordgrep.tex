\section{Introduction}

\section{Specifications}
Write a utility with the following syntax:

      wordgrep dictfile [inputfile ...]

wordgrep parses a dictionary file as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item a line with a single word defines a word to be found in the input stream
\item empty lines and line starting with \# are ignored
\end{itemize}
   wordgrep then filters (to the standard output) its input stream, the
   concatenation of all input files specified on the command line or standard
   input if none is given.  wordgrep outputs any line from the input streams that
   contains one of the words from the dictfile. Matching is performed on a full
   word basis.  Words are delimited by white space.

   Implementation should be simple and efficient, dictionary size should be
   limited only by memory,

      An arbitrary limit on line length is OK for the dictionary, but should
   be unnecessary on input stream. 

\section{Existing alternatives}
Why not try this:
grep -wf dictfile [inputfile ...]

\section{Implementation}
\subsection{function parseDictionary}
This function is used to parse and load the dictionary content in memory.
\subsubsection{Words storage}
Words are stored in memory, concatened, and separed by a pipe. That way permit to use the strstr function on the words list.\\
Alternative is to manage an array of char*. However the grep operation would be more time consumming (but it permits to use the full memory capacity).\\
Memory is allocated first for a "big" size. and then reallocated each time it's necessary for a defined size (that doesn't equal to the size of the word to store).\\
Alternative is to reallocate the memory for each word, but this lead to poor performances and a worst memory fragmentation.
\subsubsection{Dictionnary file reading and filtering}
Dictionnary file is read line by line. The variable used to store the line is size limited abitrary. This will be a known limitation.\\
Lines are left and right trimed before tested.\\
Empty lines are ignored.\\
Lines beginning with a "\#" are ignored.\\
Lines containing a white space are ignored with a warning message.
\subsubsection{Dictionnary context}
The context of the dictionnary contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item The number of words stored
\item The size of the biggest word
\end{itemize}

\subsection{function openInput}
\subsection{function readInput}
This function extracts data from input flux. The data is read character by character (getc function)
The character is stored in the current word.
When a white space is read then
If the current line doesn't contain a dictionnary word, then call the grepWord function
Clear the current word and begin a new one
When a new line is read:
If the current line contains a dictionnary word, then go back to the beginning of the line (fsetpos function) et write the line (fwrite)
Store the position in the file (fgetpos function).
When input flux is ended then exit the function

\subsection{function grepWord}
This function handle a single full word and check its existence in the dictionnary.
The word is stored between two pipes and then, the function strstr is used.
Returns "True" if word is found in the dictionnary, else "False".
